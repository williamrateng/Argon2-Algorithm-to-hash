Secure Password Hasher
This Java application demonstrates the secure hashing and verification of passwords using the Argon2 hashing algorithm, one of the most robust hashing algorithms available today.
Argon2 was the winner of the Password Hashing Competition and is recommended for password hashing due to its efficiency and security.

Features
Secure Password Hashing: Implements Argon2 for hashing passwords, ensuring strong security against brute-force attacks.
Password Verification: Checks if an input password matches the stored hash, which is crucial for authentication processes.

Requirments
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above.
Dependency on de.mkammerer.argon2 package, which can be included via Maven or Gradle.
